For this reason Scikit-Learn is often the first tool in a data scientist's toolkit for machine learning of incoming data sets.\n",

    "The coefficient of determination (R squared or R^2) indicates how well data fit a statistical model – sometimes simply a line or a curve. An R^2 of 1 indicates that the regression line perfectly fits the data, while an R^2 of 0 indicates that the line does not fit the data at all. This latter can be because the data is non-linear, or because it is random."
